<h3>Achievement</h3>
<p>Kalam's professional career was initiated when he joined DRDO and worked on a Hovercraft design. He rose to critical importance when he became, in 1969, the project director for SLV-III in the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), where he led the team that achieved orbiting of Rohini satellite in 1980. This facilitated a huge stepping stone in India's progress in space technology.

In the late 1980s, Kalam moved on to missile design and headed the Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme (IGMDP). His efforts resulted in the successful development of key missiles such as AGNI and PRITHVI, which became the backbone of Indian defence capabilities.</p>
